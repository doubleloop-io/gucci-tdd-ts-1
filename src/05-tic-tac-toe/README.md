## Tic Tac Toe
We are developing the module used by a GUI to keep the state of Tic-tac-toe. The users playing the game will click on a GUI which in turn will invoke our module

### Game Setup
- One board – 3 x 3 cells
- Two players – O & X
- Players take turns

### Game Rules
- Player One starts
- A mark can only be placed on an empty position
- Game ends if...
  - board full
  - only one symbol per
  - column, row or diagonal

### Additional constraints/request
- Expose a way (function/method/property) to know the status of the game:
  - Next player turn: "X|O turn"
  - One of the players wins: "X|O wins"
  - The board is full: "Draw"

### TODO
- What's the first test?
-
